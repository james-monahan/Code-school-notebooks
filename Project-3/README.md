Project Description:  
Coldstart Movie Recommendation system and visualizations. 

Project goal was to create recommendation engine and provide a dashboard on movie stats for a faux client.

Group Project, only posted my own work.

Method:
- I integrated IMBD and Movie lens data to provide a database for analysis.
- I created a function to filter the dataset for testing the recommendations.
- Additional work to clean data and reshape for ML.
- Utilized NearestNeigbors from Sklearn to find top 5 recommendations.
- Utilized Google colab interface as UI.
- Visualization engines also created using Colab UI.
- My results were used in project demo.
- Algo demoed well, however, 'Titanic' recommendations were not found compelling.
