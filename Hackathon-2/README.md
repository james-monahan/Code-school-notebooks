Project Description:
Open-ended project to provide an analysis on recipes from Marmiton.org.

Our process:
- Scrape recipes using beautiful soup
- Provide analysis on ingredients
- Platlist generator to match recipe time
- Visualize using Dash

My contribution:
- Perform NLP on recipes to isolate ingredients.
- Proposed and created function to find 'magic ingredients'
- 'Magic' function removed the most common ingredients of a type of recipe and then returned the additional ingredients of the highest-rated recipes.
- Function was also utilized to find the most common ingredients of a particular type which was used in visualization.
- Created plalist function using Spotify API
